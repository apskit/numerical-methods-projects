# Comparative Analysis of Elevation Profile Approximation Methods

This project implements and analyzes two interpolation approximation methods:
 - Lagrange Interpolating Polynomial
 - Cubic Spline Functions

The Python code was used to process real-world data provided for the project, validate the implemented methods, generate visualizations, and compare their accuracy. The results of the analysis are presented in the report.
