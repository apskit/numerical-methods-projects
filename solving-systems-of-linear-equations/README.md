# Comparative Analysis of Iterative and Direct Methods for Solving Systems of Linear Equations

This project implements and analyzes three methods for solving systems of linear equations using Python:
 - Jacobi Method (iterative)
 - Gauss-Seidel Method (iterative)
 - LU Factorization (direct)

The Python code was used to perform calculations, visualize results, and compare the efficiency of the implemented methods. The results of the analysis are presented in the report.
